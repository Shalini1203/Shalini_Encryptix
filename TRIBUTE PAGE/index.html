            <h2>About Albert Einstein</h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born physicist who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century.</p>
            <p>He is best known for his theory of relativity and the famous equation E=mcÂ²,fundamentally changed our understanding of space, time, and energy. </p>
            <p>Beyond relativity, Einstein made significant contributions to quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and cosmology.</p>
            <p>Despite facing political challenges, including fleeing Nazi Germany in 1933, Einstein continued his scientific work in the United States.</p>
            <p>His legacy extends beyond science; he was also a passionate advocate for peace and civil rights.</p>
